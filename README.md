## The Algorithm

To start, I found a file with lots of different pictures of all different coins. I only decited to go with three different coins, cents, euros, and chinese yuan. I put the images into three different files, test, train, and val, they all have different intentions. The tests file is where you pick the picture you want the computer to figure out. Train is where the computer learns the different types of coins and catogorzes them based on shape and color. The val file is what the computer looks at when you pick a coin form the tests, it does this so that it can find similarities between them.
